				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br>
				<p><font color="black">Q1. Carpooling. Why should I?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">Well, for starters, there is the benefit of saving fuel. Plus, a surprising amount of people using personal vehicles to travel to a particular destination are open to the idea of sharing rides with acquaintances. A carpool might be the start of a good friendship!</font></p>
				<p><font color="black">Q2. I don't trust strangers. What then?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">Keeping obvious security concerns in mind, we have segregated users into different categories. Users who provide some sort of an authentication (like a driving licence) are classed as "authenticated" users. In the misfortunate circumstance that something goes wrong, we have all the details needed to get them!</font></p>
				<p><font color="black">Q3. What about unauthenticated users?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">Unauthenticated users are solely the risk of the user hitching a ride. We make our best efforts to keep our system clean, but cannot make any guarantees about them. We definitely insist that all users registering authenticate themselves ASAP!</font></p>
				<p><font color="black">Q4. Are there separate accounts for posting and reserving rides?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">No. Any user can be a poster of rides or be reserving rides at any given time. There are no separate accounts.</font></p>
				<p><font color="black">Q5. Is there a fee to use this system?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">Not an outright fee as such. This website is mainly supported by advertisements. Also, we charge a small percentage from whatever the users earn from the people sharing their vehicle. This helps us pay for servers and coffee that keeps us awake when we work on improving the website!</font></p>
				<p><font color="black">Q6. Is there a cost involved with hitching a ride?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">Users offering you a ride may or may not ask for a nominal fee. We suggest recommended prices to every user posting a ride based on the length of the trip and other parameters like vehicle quality (Air-Conditioned or not etc). It is up to the poster to follow these recommendations or not. Some may not charge anything at all. We as such don't charge anything from someone just making a reservation for a trip.</font></p>
				<p id="Q7"><font color="black">Q7. Does the system rate users?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">Yes. The website uses <i>Negative Flags</i> which are system generated negative ratings given to a user when the user does an action which is inconvenient to others. These actions mainly include cancelling or editing a post after there are already one or more reservations on it.</font></p>
				<p id="Q8"><font color="black">Q8. What if I have a complaint about some user?</font></p>
				<p><font size="3">If the user changes or edits a post in which you have put in a reservation, then you can report the user.</font></p>
				<p><font color="black"> My question still remains unanswered..</p>
				<p><font size="3">Head over to the <a href="/contactus/"><i>Contact Us</i></a> page and we have listed ways to contact us. We'll be happy to help in any way possible.</font></p>

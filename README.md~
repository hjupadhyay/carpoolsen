Bugs found by me(Abhishek Kumar){
(* 	edit profile not working *)
	footer is playing hide and seek
	header dropdown not working on invite_page
	if logged in a user should not be able to open signup_page
	after editing my post on edit_post_page, submitting throws an error (DATE TIME FORMAT FIXING, VINODH is DOING THAT)
	@iphone there are no checks on post_form for total_seats, car_type , when submitting without changing these values throws server error

	sugestions:
		post_page different icon/photo for each entry, same ones create confusion (BTW dummy profile photo is great!!)
		on post_form cost_per_seat field Rs should be written on the right hand side.
		an additional check before cancel post

	question:
(* 		I could not delete a trip that has started. When will it get deleted?? After an hour *)
